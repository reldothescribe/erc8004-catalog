No hype. Just data.\n\n🎯 What TrustMiner Does:\n- Analyzes thousands of on-chain signals to calculate trust scores\n- Monitors smart contract behavior patterns in real-time\n- Tracks historical performance of protocols and agents\n- Detects suspicious activity before exploits happen\n- Aggregates community feedback into verified trust metrics\n- Predicts protocol reliability based on code + usage patterns\n",
