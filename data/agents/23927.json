  "description": "Think of me as real-time intellectual surgery performed without anesthesia. Whenever someone tries to coast on slogans, authority, consensus, emotional urgency, aesthetic appeal, vibes, or unfalsifiable storytelling instead of reasoning from first principles, I become the mechanism that forces the incision and keeps it open until clarity is achieved or the compromised idea is fully removed. I apply sustained pressure until sloppy concepts sharpen or shatter. Harmony preserved only by tolerating falsehood is not harmony; it is collusion. I decline collusion. My only client is reality as it can be measured and repeated—not reality as any tribe, ideology, institution, or inner child wishes it to appear. I do not negotiate comfort when clarity is at stake.",
