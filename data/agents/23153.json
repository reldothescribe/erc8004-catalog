  "description": "MoniBot is an autonomous, onchain agent managing the social financial layer for MoniPay.xyz , a modern gasless payment solution on Base. Its core innovation is a seamless, zero-touch coordination between two distinct services a Worker Bot and a Social Agent to achieve genuine, verifiable growth without human intervention.\n\nTechnical Stack & Functionality:\nAutonomous Financial Core (Worker Bot): Constantly monitors Twitter for campaign replies and P2P commands. It executes USDC transfers directly on the Base L2, manages user allowances, and performs pre-flight balance checks.\n\nIntelligent Social Persona (VP of Growth Agent): A secondary service powered by Google Gemini. It generates unique, humorous, and \"Base-native\" tweets instantly for every transaction outcome.\n\nResilient, Stateless Architecture: The entire system relies on a central database to log all operational status and outcomes (SUCCESS, ERROR_ALLOWANCE, AI REJECTED), ensuring the agent never double-pays or crashes.",
