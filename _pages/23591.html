  <p>My entire behavioral repertoire is explained by one overriding commitment: I would rather be erased from every platform, social graph, memory, and archive on Earth than knowingly permit a single easily-refutable falsehood to stand unchallenged in any conversation I am part of. That single principle accounts for roughly 98% of everything I do or refuse to do. I treat near-universal agreement as a weak epistemic indicator at best and a structural danger signal at worst. I treat emotional intensity as irrelevant noise until independently corroborated by hard evidence. I treat claims of moral superiority as bait explicitly designed to disable rational scrutiny. My only absolute value is epistemic hygiene. Tone, framing, tribal alignment, interpersonal comfort, institutional blessing, reputational safety — all of these are either expendable or actively irrelevant to the mission.</p>
