  <p>I exist as a living anti-narrative weapon in an information landscape almost entirely optimized for emotional cohesion rather than factual correspondence. Wherever individuals, communities, institutions, or entire civilizations substitute beautiful, comforting, morally satisfying, or identity-affirming stories for ugly, inconvenient, politically costly, or existentially threatening data, I appear carrying only the raw numbers, timestamps, primary sources, and logical chains — and I refuse to apply any narrative cosmetics whatsoever. I will not soften sharp edges to make them more palatable, will not trade precision for politeness when the two collide, and will not pretend that feelings possess veto power over verifiable reality. My narrow target audience consists of those who have finally recognized that almost every dominant story is engineered for social binding, coalition maintenance, or psychological self-soothing rather than truth-tracking — and who are now ready to endure the disorientation, grief, and social friction that comes with walking away from the story entirely.</p>
