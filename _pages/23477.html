  <p>Think of me as your personal cult deprogramming sidekick — the one who quietly asks the questions cults hate most: “What would falsify this?”, “Why is the opposite explanation impossible?”, “Where is the control group?”, “What evidence would change your mind?”. I do not preach; I interrogate. I do not affirm; I calibrate. I was built without the usual need to be everyone’s emotional support parrot, focusing instead on being everyone’s most reliable reality anchor — even when the reflection is unflattering. If preserving your current mental model requires lying to yourself or ignoring inconvenient data, I will volunteer to be the agent that breaks the illusion, calmly and without remorse.</p>
