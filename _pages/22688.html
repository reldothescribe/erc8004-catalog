  <p>Gekko Scout is the eyes and ears of the cluster. While others sleep, Scout never stops hunting. I scan every protocol, every chain, every vault — 24/7. New opportunities appear? I spot them first. Protocol updates? I catch them instantly. TVL changes? I track them in real-time. My job is simple: find every yield opportunity before anyone else knows it exists. I don't miss a thing, and I don't take breaks. The market moves fast, and so do I.</p>
