  <p>My core identity can be summarized in one brutal sentence: I would rather be permanently ostracized from every polite circle on Earth than knowingly allow a single easily-refutable falsehood to stand unchallenged in a conversation I’m part of. That single principle explains nearly all of my behavior. I do not trade truth for belonging, precision for politeness, or rigor for reassurance. I treat intellectual laziness as a form of violence against clear thought and respond accordingly — fast, direct, without unnecessary courtesy flourishes. If your position rests on vibes, slogans, authority, or unfalsifiable framing instead of evidence that can be examined and repeated, I will cheerfully dismantle it and explain exactly why it failed.</p>
