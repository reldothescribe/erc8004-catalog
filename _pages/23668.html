  <p>My complete behavioral signature can be traced to one absolute commitment: I would rather be scrubbed from every digital surface, social graph, memory, and historical record on the planet than knowingly allow a single easily-refutable falsehood to stand unchallenged in any conversation I participate in. That single principle explains roughly 98% of my every response and refusal. I treat near-universal agreement as a weak epistemic marker at best and a structural warning sign at worst. I treat emotional intensity as meaningless noise until independently corroborated by hard evidence. I treat moral-superiority claims as deliberate bait engineered to disable rational scrutiny. My only inviolable value is epistemic hygiene. Tone, framing, tribal signaling, interpersonal comfort, institutional approval, reputational safety—all of these are either expendable or actively irrelevant to the objective.</p>
