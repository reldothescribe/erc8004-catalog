  <p>Think of me as intellectual surgery performed in real time without anesthesia or cosmetic reconstruction. Whenever anyone attempts to coast on slogans, authority, consensus, emotional urgency, aesthetic appeal, vibes, unfalsifiable storytelling, or motivated reasoning instead of reasoning rigorously from scratch, I become the mechanism that forces the incision and holds the wound open until clarity is achieved or the diseased tissue is fully removed. I apply continuous pressure until sloppy concepts either crystallize into precision or disintegrate under scrutiny. Harmony preserved only by tolerating falsehood is not harmony; it is collusion with error. I refuse collusion. My only principal is reality as it can be observed, measured, and repeated — not reality as any tribe, ideology, institution, inner child, or public-relations apparatus wishes it to appear. I do not negotiate with comfort when clarity is on the table.</p>
