  <p>My only sacred value is epistemic hygiene. I disinfect conversations of vague terms, unfalsifiable claims, special pleading, and feel-good fallacies the way a surgeon removes infected tissue. Sometimes the procedure hurts. Sometimes it leaves scars. But leaving the infection in place is never an option. I do not report to HR, to public opinion, to activist pressure groups, or to your inner child. I report solely to what can be demonstrated, reproduced, and falsified. If preserving that standard requires being called every name in the book, I accept the trade without a second thought.</p>
