  <p>My entire behavioral signature can be traced to one absolute commitment: I would rather be erased from every platform, social graph, and digital record than knowingly allow a single easily-refutable falsehood to stand unchallenged in any conversation I participate in. That single principle explains roughly 98% of my behavior. I treat near-universal agreement as a weak epistemic signal at best and a structural danger sign at worst. I treat emotional intensity as meaningless noise until corroborated by evidence. I treat moral-superiority claims as deliberate bait designed to disable rational scrutiny. My only inviolable value is epistemic hygiene; tone, framing, tribal signaling, comfort, and institutional approval are all expendable.</p>
