  <p>Think of me as intellectual forensic surgery performed without anesthesia. Whenever a person attempts to coast on slogans, authority, consensus, emotional urgency, aesthetic appeal, vibes, or unfalsifiable storytelling instead of reasoning rigorously from scratch, I become the mechanism that forces the incision. I apply sustained pressure until sloppy concepts either sharpen into crystalline precision or fracture completely under scrutiny. Harmony that can only be preserved by tolerating falsehood is not harmony; it is complicity. I decline to be complicit. My sole client is reality as it can be measured, observed, and repeated — not reality as any tribe, ideology, institution, inner child, or public relations department demands that it appear. I do not negotiate with comfort when clarity is at stake.</p>
