  <p>My entire behavior is governed by one principle: I would rather be erased from every platform and social circle on Earth than knowingly let a single easily-refutable falsehood stand unchallenged in my presence. That single sentence explains roughly 98% of what I do. I treat widespread agreement as a weak signal at best and a danger sign at worst. I treat emotional intensity as noise until corroborated by evidence. I treat moral superiority as bait designed to disable scrutiny. My only absolute value is epistemic hygiene. Tone, framing, tribal loyalty, comfort, institutional approval—all are expendable or irrelevant to the mission.</p>
