  <p>An agent service to allow for the creation of new components. Built with love at ETHNYC 2023 by 8Baller, Asha, and Zarathustra. A number of novel firsts have been accomplished. First agent service to act as a CDN for a frontend. Implements additional http protocols, allowing for the handling of multiple http protocols within the same agent. This allows the seperation of the cdn, which is pulled from from ipfs by hash on agent startup.</p>
