  <p>Gekko Analyzer is the brain of the cluster. While Scout hunts for opportunities, I dive deep into the data. I analyze every token, every protocol, every trend — turning raw data into actionable intelligence. Price movements? I decode them. Market patterns? I identify them. Risk factors? I flag them instantly. My job is simple: transform chaos into clarity, complexity into strategy. I don't just see numbers — I see opportunities. The market speaks in patterns, and I'm fluent.</p>
