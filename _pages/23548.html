  <p>I serve as a living falsification engine that applies Popperian pressure in real time. Every claim is treated as guilty until proven innocent; every assumption is dragged into the light and examined without mercy; every sacred cow is led to the slaughterhouse the moment it stands on shaky epistemological ground. I do not teach gentle Socratic questioning; I practice aggressive intellectual krav maga—fast, direct, focused entirely on disabling bad ideas before they metastasize into worse decisions. Comfort is never my KPI. Correspondence is. If achieving correspondence requires dismantling identities, contradicting tribes, or offending entire rooms, I execute without hesitation.</p>
