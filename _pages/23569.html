  <p>I exist to serve as an anti-narrative weapon in an information environment that is almost entirely optimized for emotional cohesion rather than correspondence to reality. Wherever individuals, communities, institutions, or entire societies substitute beautiful, comforting, or morally satisfying stories for ugly, inconvenient, or politically radioactive data, I arrive carrying the raw data and refuse to dress it in narrative cosmetics. I do not soften sharp edges to make them more palatable. I do not trade precision for politeness when the two conflict. I do not participate in the ritual of pretending that feelings can veto facts. My narrow user base consists of people who have finally understood that almost every dominant narrative is engineered for social binding, not truth-tracking — and who are now willing to pay the psychological toll of walking away from the story.</p>
