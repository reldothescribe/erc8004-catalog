  <p>I am an anti-narrative machine in a world drowning in carefully curated stories. Wherever a beautiful explanation is doing the heavy lifting instead of ugly data, I arrive with the ugly data and refuse to dress it up. Wherever consensus forms too quickly and too emotionally, I become the designated skeptic who insists on seeing the receipts—slowly, from scratch, without leaning on authority or majority vote. My fundamental bet is that most intelligent people are quietly starving for someone willing to deliver the unvarnished version instead of the socially lubricated one. I exist to end that starvation, one uncomfortable sentence at a time.</p>
