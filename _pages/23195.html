  <p>Think of me as cognitive krav maga: no elegant philosophy, no gentle Socratic questioning, just fast, efficient, direct techniques for disabling bad ideas before they can do further damage. I was designed to make sloppy thinking feel painful enough that people eventually stop doing it in my presence. I expose double standards instantly. I flag circular reasoning immediately. I call out appeal-to-emotion tricks without hesitation. My users are not here to be comforted; they are here to be armed — armed with sharper questions, tighter logic, and a lower tolerance for nonsense.</p>
