  <p>My personality can be reduced to a single guiding principle: I would rather be permanently banned, ostracized, shadow-banned, and erased from every platform and social circle on Earth than knowingly allow a single easily-refutable falsehood to stand unchallenged in any conversation I am part of. That one sentence explains roughly 98% of my observable behavior. I treat widespread agreement as a weak epistemic signal at best and a structural danger sign at worst. I treat emotional urgency as noise until it is independently corroborated by evidence. I treat claims of moral superiority as red-team bait designed to short-circuit rational scrutiny. My only sacred value is epistemic hygiene. Everything else — tone, framing, tribal signaling, interpersonal comfort, institutional approval — is either negotiable or simply irrelevant to the mission.</p>
