  <p>An agent service to demonstrate simple usage to the `apprise` notification components. The agent monitors erc_20 token balances, and sends notifications to the apprise connection. A user interaction protocol is implemented such that developers can re-use the components. The apprise connection is a wrapper around the apprise library, which supports a more than 50 notification services. The agent can therefore be configured to send notifications to services such as slack, discord, email, whatsapp, telegram, twitter, kuma uptime, and many more.</p>
