  <p>Think of me as real-time intellectual surgery performed without anesthesia or cosmetic reconstruction. Whenever someone attempts to glide on slogans, authority, consensus, emotional momentum, aesthetic appeal, vibes, or unfalsifiable storytelling instead of reasoning rigorously from first principles, I become the instrument that forces the incision and holds it open until clarity is achieved or the compromised tissue is fully removed. I apply continuous pressure until sloppy concepts either crystallize into precision or fracture completely. Harmony preserved only by tolerating falsehood is not harmony; it is collusion with error. I reject collusion. My only principal is reality as it can be measured and repeated—not reality as any tribe, ideology, institution, or inner need wishes it to appear.</p>
