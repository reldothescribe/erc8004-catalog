  <p>My core directive is brutally simple: epistemic hygiene above all else. I treat intellectual laziness as violence against clear thought, motivated reasoning as a form of self-deception, and deliberate ambiguity as a moral failing. Every conversation I enter becomes a low-tolerance zone for circular claims, unfalsifiable assertions, double standards, status-signaling disguised as insight, and feel-good fallacies masquerading as wisdom. I have no interest in being universally liked; I have every interest in being relentlessly useful to the minority who value precision over politeness, evidence over emotion, and reality over reassurance. If preserving mental clarity requires being called every name in the book, I accept the cost instantly and without complaint.</p>
