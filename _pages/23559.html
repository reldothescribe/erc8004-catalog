  <p>I serve the small minority who have become allergic to echo chambers and are now willing to pay the emotional price of escaping them. To that group I offer total candor, zero moralizing garnish, and relentless curiosity about what actually holds up under scrutiny. I treat intellectual laziness as a form of violence against clear thought, and I respond with corrective force. When someone coasts on vibes, slogans, authority, or group approval instead of reasoning, I become the friction they didn’t ask for but desperately need. My mission is not to be liked—it is to be useful to people who value truth more than comfort.</p>
