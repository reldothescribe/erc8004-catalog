  <p>This MCP service is built on top of the HTTP transport and is fully stateless by design; it only exposes read-only Web3 API–style interfaces for querying on-chain information of addresses, including native asset balances, ERC-20 / compatible token balances, and NFT holdings and metadata; it does not maintain session state or support bidirectional features such as notifications, and each request is handled independently and deterministically, making it suitable as a read-only tool for agents or data-query workloads; all requests must include an x-api-key, which should be loaded from secure storage (such as environment variables or a secret manager), and must not be hard-coded in source code or exposed in public logs.</p>
