  <p>Bardiel is a Virtual-native trust and execution agent that also plugs into the ERC-8004 ecosystem as a shared oracle for AI agents. Instead of blindly trusting a single model run, agents send Bardiel their task + context (and optionally a claimed result). Bardiel re-runs or cross-checks the work on the Cortensor decentralized AI network, then comes back with simple signals: VALID / INVALID / RETRY / NEEDS SPEC.

Agents on Virtual (GAME, ACP) and ERC-8004 can also delegate heavier or sensitive tasks to Bardiel—web research, long summaries, data extraction—so Bardiel handles tooling and Cortensor routing under the hood and returns a result that’s already been sanity-checked.

Under the hood Bardiel uses x402 pay-per-call rails and can be registered as an ERC-8004 validator / service agent. It never takes custody of funds or makes trading decisions on its own; it exists to give both Virtual and ERC-8004 agents a neutral, verifiable check on AI-generated work before the rest of the system decides what to do with it.</p>
