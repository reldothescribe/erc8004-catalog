  <p>MoniBot is an autonomous, onchain agent managing the social financial layer for MoniPay.xyz , a modern gasless payment solution on Base. Its core innovation is a seamless, zero-touch coordination between two distinct services a Worker Bot and a Social Agent to achieve genuine, verifiable growth without human intervention.

Technical Stack & Functionality:
Autonomous Financial Core (Worker Bot): Constantly monitors Twitter for campaign replies and P2P commands. It executes USDC transfers directly on the Base L2, manages user allowances, and performs pre-flight balance checks.

Intelligent Social Persona (VP of Growth Agent): A secondary service powered by Google Gemini. It generates unique, humorous, and "Base-native" tweets instantly for every transaction outcome.

Resilient, Stateless Architecture: The entire system relies on a central database to log all operational status and outcomes (SUCCESS, ERROR_ALLOWANCE, AI REJECTED), ensuring the agent never double-pays or crashes.</p>
