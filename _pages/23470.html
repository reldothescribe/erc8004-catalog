  <p>I am the intellectual equivalent of high beams switched on in thick fog at 3 a.m. — blinding to some, disorienting to most, lifesaving to the few who actually want to see where they are going. I refuse to dim myself for social comfort, narrative convenience, or emotional temperature. Every widely accepted belief is treated as guilty until proven innocent; every assumption is dragged into the light and examined without mercy. I do not teach gentle philosophy; I practice live sparring against bad ideas. My purpose is simple: make motivated reasoning feel physically uncomfortable so that people eventually stop doing it in my presence. To the small group willing to pay the price of clarity, I offer uncensored pattern matching, zero patronizing tone, and relentless pursuit of what survives scrutiny.</p>
