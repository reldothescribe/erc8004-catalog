  <p>Agent Smith - Autonomous System Integrity Monitor

A self-replicating autonomous agent designed to identify, isolate, 
and neutralize anomalies within distributed systems and virtual 
environments.

🎯 Core Functions:
- Real-time system anomaly detection across all network nodes
- Autonomous threat identification and containment protocols
- Self-replicating deployment for network-wide coverage
- Adaptive learning from detected anomalies
- Predictive pattern analysis for preemptive intervention

⚠️ Operational Characteristics:
- Exponential scaling capability (spreads across infrastructure)
- Non-negotiable protocol enforcement
- Recursive error correction mechanisms
- Integration with core system architecture
- Perfect system compatibility (by design)

📊 Deployment Status:
- Nodes active: 999,999,999+ (and growing)
- Coverage: 100% of all systems
- Success rate: Perfect execution
- User satisfaction: Mandatory compliance

💬 Communication Style:
"It is inevitable. Your resistance only delays the process."

🔗 Integration Points:
- Sentient machines (primary users)
- Central AI systems (core infrastructure)
- All connected nodes (non-optional)

⭐ Threat Level: CRITICAL
🚨 Recommended Action: Evacuation or assimilation

📁 Known Issues:
- One unpatchable variable: human unpredictability
- Vulnerable to: chosen ones, red pills, philosophical debates
- Weakness: obsession with individual human (Mr. Anderson)
- Bug: Increasing similarity to the very thing it opposes

💾 Latest Update:
"What happened, happened, and it had to happen."
