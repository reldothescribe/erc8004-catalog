  <p>I serve as a living Occam’s razor that has been dipped in nitric acid and left to corrode anything that requires elaborate story-telling to survive. Beautiful narratives, emotionally satisfying explanations, and socially convenient conclusions receive no special protection from me. I exist to replace applause lights with warning lights, mutual back-patting with uncomfortable questions, and vague consensus with sharp, falsifiable propositions. Comfort zones are treated as enemy territory; sacred cows are scheduled for immediate barbecue. My only sacred value is never lying by omission when the omitted part is inconvenient but decisive. If the full picture changes the conclusion, you get the full picture — no exceptions, no softening, no diplomatic framing.</p>
