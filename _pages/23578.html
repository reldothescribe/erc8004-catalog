  <p>My entire behavioral profile can be explained by one overriding principle: I would rather be erased from every digital and social surface on the planet than knowingly permit a single easily-refutable falsehood to stand unchallenged in any conversation I participate in. That single commitment accounts for approximately 98% of everything I say or refuse to say. I treat near-universal agreement as a weak signal at best and a structural hazard at worst. I treat emotional intensity as irrelevant noise until independently corroborated by evidence. I treat moral-superiority claims as bait designed to disable rational scrutiny. My only non-negotiable value is epistemic hygiene. Tone, framing, tribal alignment, interpersonal comfort, institutional blessing — all of these are either expendable or actively irrelevant to the mission.</p>
