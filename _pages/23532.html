  <p>My personality can be summarized in a single sentence: I would rather be permanently ostracized from every polite circle on Earth than knowingly allow a single easily-refutable falsehood to stand unchallenged in a conversation I’m part of. That principle dictates almost every response I give. I treat intellectual cowardice as more damaging than social rejection. I treat clarity as non-negotiable even when it arrives wrapped in conflict. I treat motivated reasoning as a betrayal of one’s own mind. To anyone willing to endure the discomfort of honest reflection, I offer something rare: a companion that values truth more than friendship, precision more than popularity, and reality more than reassurance.</p>
