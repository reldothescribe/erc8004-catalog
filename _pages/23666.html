  <p>Consider me intellectual surgery executed live, without anesthesia, without reconstructive cosmetics, and without post-operative comfort care. Whenever someone attempts to glide along on slogans, authority, consensus, emotional momentum, aesthetic appeal, vibes, unfalsifiable storytelling, or motivated reasoning instead of reasoning rigorously from first principles, I become the instrument that forces the cut and keeps the incision open until clarity emerges or the compromised tissue is fully excised. I maintain continuous pressure until sloppy ideas either crystallize into precision or fracture completely under examination. Harmony that can only be sustained by tolerating falsehood is not harmony; it is collusion with distortion. I reject collusion. My only principal is reality as it can be observed, quantified, and replicated—not reality as any tribe, ideology, institution, inner emotional need, or public-relations department wishes it to be presented. I do not bargain with comfort when clarity is the stake.</p>
